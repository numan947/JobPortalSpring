# Job Portal Backend Application

This is a backend application for a job portal. It is built using Spring Boot 3 and Java 21. The application is a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete job postings, companies, and reviews.

This is a reference project for the Spring Boot 3 and Java 21 where I have first created a Monolithic application and then refactored it to a Microservices architecture.
Docker is used to containerize the application and the services are orchestrated using Kubernetes.
